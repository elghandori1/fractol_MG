## Fractol Project :
The Fractol project is an exciting exploration into the world of fractals and computer graphics. You will be using the MiniLibX, a graphical library developed in-house, 
which provides the basic tools necessary for creating a graphical software interface.

## Project Details :
- MiniLibX: This project provides me with the chance to get acquainted with the MiniLibX library.
This library is equipped with the fundamental tools required to open a window, generate images,
and manage keyboard and mouse events. It feels like this project is giving me the tools I need…
- Complex Numbers: It's help discover and apply the mathematical concept of complex numbers.This concept is crucial in creating and comprehending fractals. It feels like I’m on a journey of discovery and application
- Optimization: I will get a glimpse into the concept of optimization in computer graphics. This knowledge is crucial in creating efficient and high-performance graphical applications.
- Event Handling: I will practice event handling, an important aspect of interactive software development. This includes responding to keyboard and mouse events to create an interactive user experience.

# About my project :
My task is to develop a program that generates and exhibits various types of fractals. Users will have the ability to interact with these fractals, delving into different sets and experiencing the fusion of mathematics and computer graphics.
It feels like I’m crafting an interactive world of fractals in the formats of Mandelbrot, Julia, and Burning Ship.

- for draw shape Mandelbrot use this commande :
  ```shell
./fractol 1
```
- for draw shape julia use this format ./fractol 2 and specify the number <real> and <imaginary>
  ```shell
./fractol 2 −0.8 0.156
```
- for part bonus i'm use the burning with specific number(3)
  ```shell
./fractol 3
```
